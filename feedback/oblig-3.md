Overall feedback.

A really! good experience playing your chess game.

 - UI looks nice, nice menu options, colors and graphics.
 - Good README and other git files.
 - Maybe too short minutes but good issues screen-shoots.
 - Licensing coverage was good enough. Good.

+ Aspects to improve in the deliverables:

The UML diagram is missing the attributes in each class.
They should have also their respective type, also for the methods.


Checkout the design model following the examples sent by Torill
and improve yours please as long as possible. :)

You may think to include the [integration for testing](https://about.gitlab.com/features/gitlab-ci-cd/)
provided by Gitlab. That would help us to check everything is fine with
your tests instead of running them in our computers everytime.

**Score: 90.0 (of 100)**
**Evaluation: PASS**

Feedback INF112 Spring 2018 - Oblig 2

Group: Group 5

#### Overall feedback

Good delivery:
  - Overall good answers on most of the tasks
  - Very good structure and presentation of documents
  - Arrangements of meetings are good but too short.

The "resources" section (should be References or Bibliography) in
almost every document needs to be formatted (improved). We suggest you
to improve this using a latex package for such a purpose like bibtex,
natbib, among others. See some examples in sharelatex documentation.
This advice is also about removing the picture reference using
repeatedly "(JohnPablok, 2018)".  You may state this as a comment at
the beginning of the product user manual.

#### Content

+ Product specification

  Overall items we found good answers. User stories were good (some
  misspellings), the diagram looks nice but can do better by
  improving the functionality. Both use cases are good, and they show
  us the effort of the team to make them clear also the explanation of
  the domain model.

+ Team plan

  Very nice git explanation.
  Every item was in the documentation as we demand
  and it was also included a nice picture for
  the structure of the repository and the git repo structure as well.

+ User manual

  Clear user group and goal. Missing some key features, and also missing some rules for when the
  game ends, e.g. winning, resigning and so on. Also some errors with the figures 7,8,9, and 10.

+ Project plan and process

  Very good overall, description of chosen process could be better (describe what scrum is a bit more, and describe the
  changes you are going to make to this process). Some misspellings.

+ Retrospective summary

  Very good, only missing some tools, like what you are going to use to develop the game (e.g. libGDX, javafx etc.)

+ Presentation

  Slides could be prepared better, e.g. including a picture per slide, the same illustrations you used in other documents or other support material.

+ Team organization

  We found the documents good, it shows me good effort
  and distribution of the task for this assignment.

##### Main changes to, and use of open source inspriation code

+ Our code uses JavaFX as its GUI framwork instead of Swing
+ Our code uses coordinate(x,y) representation instead of tile numbering (0-64)
+ All tests are writting from scratch
+ No code has been directly copied but written line by line to judge if it's  
  feature/function "x" was nessesarcy, and after this expanded upon where needed.

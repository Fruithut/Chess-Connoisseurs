	We have decided on which of the functionalities we want and can implement this iteration.
	We have decided to chose:
- Offer another non-trivial rule set for chess. (Remember to explain the rules.)
- Chess Tutor commenting on moves you make and telling to win the game in 3-5 moves.
- Cool animation of moves.

Since we already have the coolest animations. We will have the main focus on function 1 and 2.
More detailed tasks will be given on the next meeting on thursday.

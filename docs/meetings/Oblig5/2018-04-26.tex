	We have implemented a game mode called hoard, which is one of the two game modes we will implemented this iteration
	We have decided to not implement chess tutor, but rather two different game modes. But we have decided to
	make all game modes other than original to offline modes - that we will not save gamescore. Maybe also a offline operation
	for the original mode - to the people who is without internet.

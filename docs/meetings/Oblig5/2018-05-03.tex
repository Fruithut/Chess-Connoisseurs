Working on getting the readfile method in loadResources to work. We have some troubles on reading the file
so it worked while it was packed as a jar. Some other bug fixes and changed some scaling so when you
adjust the window the statpanel is removed, so you could play with only seeing the board and nothing else.
Will continue to get the readfile method to work.

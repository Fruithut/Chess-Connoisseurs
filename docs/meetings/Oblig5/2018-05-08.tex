	Got the readFile method to work. Now it shows the rules when you click on the help tab then the rules tab.
	it will show a highscore-ish window that shows the rules of horde and light brigade (depending on what you are playing)
	This took surprisingly long time to troubleshoot - 5 people on it for over 2 hours.

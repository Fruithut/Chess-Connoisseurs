	Progress on SQL database, now we can connect to the database. We are working on connecting the database to the
	score class. Was harder than anticipated. Now you can choose the black pieces and it shows the black pieces at the bottom
	instead of on the other side. We are discussing what we are doing next oblig and other things that we might implement.
	Started on fixing documents so they are up to date.

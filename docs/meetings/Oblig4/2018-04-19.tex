The database is officially working! The database saves the players score and stats. But if a CPU is playing
the score will be overwritten each time - because a CPU is always going to have 1200 score(on easy, 1500 on inter etc.) when starting a new game.
Other bug fixes and finished with presentation and presentation notes. Finished on converting documents to right format
and added the right documents.

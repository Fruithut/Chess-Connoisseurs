    \section{Thoughts}
    \noindent
     like earlier, we continued to hold meetings twice a week. The meetings were used to inform and explain what we had
     done seperatly. Doing this we had more control over what the others had accomplished and how we could use it to work together.
     We seperated the tasks and worked on being atleast 2 people on each task. we used Trello to track what needed to be done,
     had been done and what was still being worked on. Using Trello was a good choice, since we could mark what task we
     wanted to do, making selecting and dividing tasks a breeze. we found out that Programming the AI from scratch was harder than expected
     and that we needed more resources for it. not only was the AI hard, there was alot of work to be done in a short timespan
     resulting in some hectic periods. Everybody in the team has started to use git, and know how to handle error and merge problems.
     Everybody got to touch the code in some way, and contribute to the project in their own way.

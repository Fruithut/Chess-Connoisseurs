    We held meetings twice a week which worked out really well, we used these meetings to discuss different aspects of the project. We agreed upon that everyone would download the same IDE so we could avoid some issues. We used draw.io to visualize the user interface while we were planning and still coming up with ideas and plans for how we wanted it to look. We also divided the work among us which helped people work more efficient and if we hit a wall we would ask some of the others for help. Once we divided the roles, we started deciding on which resources we were going to use. In the beginning we tried slack, discord, google docs and git. We settled on using discord and used google docs to write our document rather than using git document. We had to cut out slack as it didnâ€™t fit our goals for the assignment. Scheduling meeting, sharing links, and collaborating on the document worked best through the use of discord. Our git leader helped everyone get a decent understanding of our ideas for git and how we are supposed to use it.

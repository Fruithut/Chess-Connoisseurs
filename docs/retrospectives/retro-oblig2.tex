    \noindent
    All in all we did not encounter major problems during the weeks we worked with this project. Our meetings were constructive, and kept everyone on track with their "duties". Communication through Discord worked out fine, having different channels for documentation, tutorials, meeting schedules and so on helped with keeping it organized. We assume that we will use Slack more when we begin to share code snippets and more technical notation. \\ \\
    During the next exercise we want everyone on the team to get a more hands on experience with git, and really get comfortable with it. During this exercise we instead used google docs to collaborate on the initial sketches of the documents and had our git-leader upload most of the material to our repository when it was done. We also agreed that everyone will use the same IDE for the upcoming programming part of the project, and we will then use the integrated git-features that are included with this IDE (merge-tool etc).

    //FROM LAST OBLIG:
     We continued like the other iterations to hold meetings twice a week. We had some days where we booked rooms for over 2 hours (6 hours) to work on the project.
     during the meetings we worked in groups focusing on different tasks. One group worked on the SQL database and its implementations, another group worked on sound effects
     and the last group worked on fixing bugs and improving the AI. We continued using Trello to track the work progress of the different groups and what they had accomplished.
     We also talked about future implementations and ideas for the project such as different game modes.
     Implementing the SQL files and database was more difficult than expected.
     After many tries we ended up abandoning the regular SQL model and moving on to MongoDB. MongoDB was new for everyone, so all of us worked hard
     implementing it and learning the format and syntax. After a while we were able to fix the database. now we can add and update new players, track
     stats and fetch highscores from the database. The overall work amount was better suited to the time we had to finish everything, compared to earlier iterations.

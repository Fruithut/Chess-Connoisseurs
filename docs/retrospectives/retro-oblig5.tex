    \section{Thoughts}
    \noindent

    We continued like the last iterations and held 2 meetings a week, the first meeting of the week was used to get everyone up to speed and discuss the plans for the coming weeks.
    We continues using Trello and Discord to track our progress and to communicate. since the last iteration had prepared us for this one, this went a lot more fluently than expected.
    We fixed a few issues we had with the scaling of the game window.
    The animations we had previously have been updated, and added a few extra animations. we also added 2 new game modes and a tutor mode.
    Changed the design to be more appealing. We implemented some code to make the MongoDB to work offline as well.
    On the last Thursday before the deadline, we held a 4 hour meeting going through the checklist and working our way fine tuning everything we added
    this iteration
